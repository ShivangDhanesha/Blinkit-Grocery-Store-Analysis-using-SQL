# SQL_Blinkit_project
By leveraging MySQL, I have tracked sales trends, analyzed customer behavior, and identified areas for improvement. For instance, I have analyzed sales data for a particular product category or compare sales figures across different outlets to identify areas where they need to focus their efforts to increase sales.
Blinkit analyzes purchase histories to identify which products are frequently bought together and track customer feedback to gain insights into what their customers are looking for in a grocery store. By utilizing MySQL to analyze their data, Blinkit gains valuable insights into their business operations and makes informed decisions that improve their operations and customer satisfaction.
In this Case study Blinkit: Grocery Product Analysis, we have a table named 'Grocery Sales' with 12 columns including Item_Identifier, Item_Weight, Item_Fat_Content, Item_Visibility, Item_Type, Item_MRP, Outlet_Identifier, Outlet_Establishment_Year, Outlet_Size, Outlet_Location_Type, Outlet_Type and Item_Outlet_Sales. This table contains data on the sales of various grocery items across different outlets of Blinkit.
Using SQL queries in this case study, I have gained insights into customer behavior and preferences like frequently purchased items, sales trends for specific categories, and customer feedback.
